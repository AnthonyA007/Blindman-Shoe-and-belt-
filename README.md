# Blindman-Shoe-and-belt-Working
Working:
A program is written in C which is compiled in Arduino. An Ultrasonic sensor, buzzer and vibrator are connected to the microcontroller, if the sensor detects any obstacle under the specified distance, then it triggers the vibrator and buzzer letting the person know that there is an obstacle in front, so that the person can change the direction.

Components:
 Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04
 Arduino
 Pair of shoes
 Jumper Wires
 Vibrator
 Buzzer

Belt:

Components:
 1sheeld
 A fanny pack
 Jumper Wires
 2 switches

1Sheeld is a shield for Arduino that allows you to tap into your Smartphone’s sensors and
capabilities and lets you use them in your Arduino projects. Basically, It is a hardware shield that
sits on top of your Arduino board and communicates over Bluetooth to this Android app, to
transfer data between it and your smartphone.

There are two switches on the Belt,
1st switch would send an automated call to a number provided in the program.

2nd switch would send an automated SMS and open which would contain a link to our website
(www.ultrasonicshoe.cu.me/track.html); from there the relatives could easily track the person using the GPS in 1sheeld.
