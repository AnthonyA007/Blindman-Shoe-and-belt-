# Blindman-Shoe-and-belt-Working
Working:
A program is written in C which is compiled in Arduino. An Ultrasonic sensor, buzzer and vibrator are connected to the microcontroller, if the sensor detects any obstacle under the specified distance, then it triggers the vibrator and buzzer letting the person know that there is an obstacle in front, so that the person can change the direction.

There are two switches on the Belt,

1st switch would send an automated call to a number provided in the program.

2nd switch would send an automated SMS and open which would contain a link to our website
(www.ultrasonicshoe.cu.me/track.html); from there the relatives could easily track the person using the GPS in 1sheeld.
