The survey of WHO (World Health Organization) carried out in 2020 tells us that in world about 1% of the human population is visually impaired and amongst them about 10% is fully blind. The main problem with blind people is mobility.

The project proposes a tool for visually impaired people that will provide them navigation. Long white cane is a traditional mobility tool used to detect obstacles in the path of a blind person. 
The possibility of trying to remove the idea of a cane and helping the blind to walk like a normal person.

The Ultrasonic Shoe is a primary electronic mobility aid for use by people who are blind or visually impaired; it is a major "step forward" in assistive technology that allows safe obstacle avoidance and permits navigation around obstacles.
This device would allow the blind person to move independently like any normal person would.

This shoe contains Ultrasonic Obstacle Detector which detects the object in front of the person, the information is send to a microcontroller,
this microcontroller, then will trigger the buzzer and the vibrator letting the person know that there is an incoming obstacle.

A belt also comes as an add-on, this belt contains two buttons one for automated call and other for SMS. This would help the blind person to contact a relative or a friend if he/she is lost.
